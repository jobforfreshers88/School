Our primary focus is learning through play and exploration. We encourage children to grow in confidence, self-esteem and independence.

Apart from conveying of essential knowledge and skills for living, the priceless ability and confidence to study, understand and apply any subject, and an environment in which children are encouraged to communicate freely and confidently, at the Ray of Hope International school we strive to ensure that all students are happy throughout their time at the school and graduate, feeling enthusiastic about life, having developed new friendships and gained a sense of new achievement in an ethical, highly productive and motivated environment.
