      <h1>Purpose of starting Ray of Hope International School</h1>
      <p>Rural Education is very important as majority of India still lives in villages.

Quality and access to education is the major concern in rural schools as there are fewer committed teachers, lack of proper text books and learning materials in the schools.  Majority of the people living in villages have understood the importance of education and know that it is the only way to get rid of poverty.  But due to lack of money, they are not able to send their children to good schools.

Quality related issues are far powerful than poverty.  Students are not at all encouraged to think, but they are asked to memorize pre-defined questions for exams.

Having considered all these issues, we have prayerfully taken the decision to give quality education to the children of Thiruvallur District.

The children in these surrounding villages must get good education and better facilities.

We believe that by giving good education to the rural children we can bring great transformation in the society as a whole.

At the Ray of Hope International School, we want to see our students to grow up not only in educational level, but also socially, mentally and emotionally as responsible citizens, who will bring great transformation to their own society.

For that, we are providing quality education at a minimal fee of only ₹500/- per month.

We also provide free transportation to the students. We also provide them free snacks and safe mineral water for drinking.  

We also provide them uniforms, school shoes and bags at a subsidised rate.

Also we provide quarterly medical check up, eye check up and dental check up free of cost.

In order to have a smooth relationship between the parents and teachers, we arrange quarterly parent-teachers' meet.

In short, we want to give the best education to build up the future generation.
